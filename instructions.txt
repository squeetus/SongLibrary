Your task is to create a simple JavaScript song library single page application. It is up to you if you want to have a server side component to this task but it is not necessary.  If you choose not to use a web server, the responses for all AJAX requests may be mocked using the sinon.js library.  Hard-coded values for the responses are fine.  Use JSON for the data format for all AJAX requests and responses.
The application should display a list of songs.  The song list should be filterable by release date, and sortable by any attribute of the song. The user should be able to add a new song to the list, delete a song from the list, and edit any song in the list.  The user should also be able to "save" the list, which should simply send an AJAX request with the current song list values.  A message should show on a successful save of the list.  Randomly, say 1 out of 5 times, the save should fail, and a corresponding error message should be shown.

The song object should have the following attributes:
•	Id
•	Title
•	Artist
•	Release Date
•	Price

The initial list of songs should contain 5 records.
The design of the page is up to you. The application should be responsive; we should be able to run it on a phone as well as a desktop.  The design does not need to be fancy, it can be very simple.  Use the color scheme from the www.copera.org website.  

Any front end framework can be used (Angular, AngularJS,  or ReactJS preferred)

Your solution should include tests when appropriate.  

The delivery of the solution should be a Github repository.  We should be able to view a working version of your application if we download it or on Github pages.  Include a README with the decisions you had to make and why.  The final solution should include a single html file, a single concatenated and minified js file, and a single css file (though your repository could have multiple js and css files)

You are being evaluated in a few different areas:  
•	Does the application fulfill the requirements?
•	Your understanding of HTML/CSS.
•	Structure and organization of your JavaScript.
•	How did you test the application?

The purpose of this project is to get a feel of your overall understanding of the technologies used.  We will take into account your current and past experience when evaluating your finished project.
